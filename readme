This repository explores the dynamics between extreme temperature anomalies 
and long-time series data that correspond between land tower observations and ocean buoys

Under the advisory of UC Berkeley's Prof. Vargas Zeppetello,
I was intially tasked to process and plot West Coast buoy data from the National Buoy Data Center.

Through aggregating and analyzing such data, we are able to assess anomalies in extreme temperature through time-series statistics like skewness and variance to see which areas are more proned to temperature volatility, i.e. latitudes of 20* versus latitudes of 1-5*.

We then aggregated the data through high computing facilities to plot the large NBDC dataset and then compared the differences between the buoy observations and land tower observations.

More work in progress! Stay tuned.
